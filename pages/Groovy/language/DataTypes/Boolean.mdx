# Boolean

A Boolean in Groovy represents a logical value that can be either true or false. Booleans are often used in conditional statements and to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.

### Creating Booleans

Booleans can be created using the literals `true` and `false`:

```groovy
def isSunny = true
def isRaining = false
```

### Logical Operations

Groovy supports various logical operations on Boolean values:

- **Logical AND (`&&`):** Returns true if both operands are true.
- **Logical OR (`||`):** Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- **Logical NOT (`!`):** Negates the value of a Boolean.

```groovy
def isWeekend = true
def hasHomework = false

def canGoOutside = isWeekend && !hasHomework // true
```

### Conditional Statements

Boolean values are often used in conditional statements to make decisions in your code:

```groovy
def age = 18
def isAdult = age >= 18

if (isAdult) {
    println("You are an adult.")
} else {
    println("You are not an adult.")
}
```

### Example

```groovy
def isMorning = true
def isWeekend = false

def shouldWakeUpEarly = isMorning && !isWeekend

println("Is it morning? ${isMorning}")
println("Is it a weekend? ${isWeekend}")
println("Should I wake up early? ${shouldWakeUpEarly}")
```
