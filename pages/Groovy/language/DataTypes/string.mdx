# String

A String in Groovy is a sequence of characters. It represents text data and is one of the fundamental data types in the language. Strings are often used for storing and manipulating textual information.

### Creating Strings

Strings can be created using either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Here's how you can create strings:

```groovy
def singleQuoted = 'This is a single-quoted string.'
def doubleQuoted = "This is a double-quoted string."
```

### String Interpolation

String interpolation allows you to embed variables or expressions within a string using the `${}` syntax:

```groovy
def name = 'Alice'
def greeting = "Hello, ${name}!"
```

### Common String Operations

Groovy provides various methods for performing operations on strings:

- **Length:** Get the number of characters in a string.

  ```groovy
  def text = 'Hello, World!'
  def length = text.length()  // Returns 13
  ```

- **Concatenation:** Combine two or more strings.

  ```groovy
  def firstName = 'John'
  def lastName = 'Doe'
  def fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName  // Results in 'John Doe'
  ```

- **Substring:** Extract a portion of a string.

  ```groovy
  def text = 'Hello, World!'
  def substring = text[7..11]  // Returns 'World'
  ```

- **Searching:** Find the index of a substring within a string.

  ```groovy
  def text = 'Hello, World!'
  def index = text.indexOf('World')  // Returns 7
  ```

- **Replacing:** Replace occurrences of a substring with another.

  ```groovy
  def text = 'Hello, World!'
  def newText = text.replace('Hello', 'Hi')  // Results in 'Hi, World!'
  ```

- **Trimming:** Remove leading and trailing whitespace.

  ```groovy
  def text = '   Some text   '
  def trimmed = text.trim()  // Results in 'Some text'
  ```

- **Converting Case:** Change the case of a string.
  ```groovy
  def text = 'Groovy Language'
  def lowercase = text.toLowerCase()  // Results in 'groovy language'
  def uppercase = text.toUpperCase()  // Results in 'GROOVY LANGUAGE'
  ```

### String Methods and Properties

Strings in Groovy have numerous methods and properties for various text manipulation tasks. You can find more information about these methods and their usage in the Groovy documentation.

### Example

```groovy
def message = 'Hello, Groovy!'
def length = message.length()
def uppercaseMessage = message.toUpperCase()

println("Message: ${message}")
println("Length: ${length}")
println("Uppercase Message: ${uppercaseMessage}")
```

Remember that strings are immutable in Groovy, which means that operations that appear to modify a string actually return a new string with the desired changes.
